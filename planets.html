        he order of the planets in the solar system, starting nearest the sun
        and working outward is the following: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
        Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and then the possible Planet Nine. The
        solar system extends from the sun, goes past the four inner

        , through the asteroid belt to the four gas giants and on to the
        disk-shaped Kuiper Belt and far beyond to the teardrop-shaped
        heliopause. Scientists estimate that the edge of the solar system is
        about 9 billion miles (15 billion kilometers) from the sun. Beyond the
        heliopause lies the giant, spherical Oort Cloud, which is thought to
        surround the solar system. Related: 10 incredible volcanoes in our solar
        system Ever since the discovery of Pluto in 1930, kids grew up learning
        that the solar system has nine planets. That all changed in the late
        1990s when astronomers started arguing about whether Pluto was indeed a
        planet. In a highly controversial decision, the International
        Astronomical Union ultimately decided in 2006 to designate Pluto as a
        "dwarf planet," reducing the list of the solar system's true planets to
        just eight. If you insist on including Pluto, it would come after
        Neptune on the list. Pluto is truly way out there and on a wildly
        tilted, elliptical orbit (two of the several reasons it was demoted).
        Astronomers, however, are still hunting for another possible planet in
        our solar system, a true ninth planet, after mathematical evidence of
        its existence was revealed on Jan. 20, 2016. The alleged "Planet Nine,"
        also called "Planet X," is believed to be about 10 times the mass of
        Earth and 5,000 times the mass of Pluto.
