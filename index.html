      Main articles: Creation of NASA and National Advisory Committee for
      Aeronautics A U.S. Air Force Bell X-1 test flight NASA traces its roots to
      the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). Despite being the
      birthplace of aviation, by 1914 the United States recognized that it was
      far behind Europe in aviation capability. Determined to regain American
      leadership in aviation, Congress created the Aviation Section of the U.S.
      Army Signal Corps in 1914 and established NACA in 1915 to foster
      aeronautical research and development. Over the next forty years NACA
      would conduct aeronautical research in support of the U.S. Air Force, its
      predecessors in the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, and the civil aviation
      sector. After the end of World War II, NACA became interested in the
      possibilities of guided missiles and supersonic aircraft, developing and
      testing the Bell X-1 in a joint program with the U.S. Air Force. NACA's
      interest in space grew out of its rocketry program at the Pilotless
      Aircraft Research Division.Launch of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency's
      Explorer 1, America's first satellit The Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik
      1 ushered in the Space Age and kicked off the Space Race. Despite NACA's
      early rocketry program, the responsibility for launching the first
      American satellite fell to the Naval Research Laboratory's Project
      Vanguard, whose operational issues ensured the Army Ballistic Missile
      Agency would launch Explorer 1, America's first satellite, on February 1,
      1958. The Eisenhower Administration decided to split the United States'
      military and civil spaceflight programs, which were organized together
      under the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency. NASA was
      established on July 29, 1958, with the signing of the National Aeronautics
      and Space Act and it began operations on October 1, 1958. As the United
      States' premier aeronautics agency, NACA formed the core of NASA's new
      structure, absorbing its 8,000 employees and three major research
      laboratories. NASA also proceeded to absorb the Naval Research
      Laboratory's Project Vanguard, the Army's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and
      the Army Ballistic Missile Agency under Wernher von Braun. This left NASA
      firmly as the United States' civil space lead and the Air Force as the
      military space lead.

        Human spaceflight International Space Station (1993–present) Further
        information: International Space Station The International Space Station
        as seen from Space Shuttle Endeavour during STS-134 The International
        Space Station (ISS) combines NASA's Space Station Freedom project with
        the Soviet/Russian Mir-2 station, the European Columbus station, and the
        Japanese Kibō laboratory module.[17] NASA originally planned in the
        1980s to develop Freedom alone, but US budget constraints led to the
        merger of these projects into a single multi-national program in 1993,
        managed by NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA), the Japan
        Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the European Space Agency (ESA),
        and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).[18][19] The station consists of
        pressurized modules, external trusses, solar arrays and other
        components, which were manufactured in various factories around the
        world, and have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and
        the US Space Shuttles.[17] The on-orbit assembly began in 1998, the
        completion of the US Orbital Segment occurred in 2009 and the completion
        of the Russian Orbital Segment occurred in 2010, though there are some
        debates of whether new modules should be added in the segment. The
        ownership and use of the space station is established in
        intergovernmental treaties and agreements[20] which divide the station
        into two areas and allow Russia to retain full ownership of the Russian
        Orbital Segment (with the exception of Zarya),[21][22] with the US
        Orbital Segment allocated between the other international partners.
        Long-duration missions to the ISS are referred to as ISS Expeditions.
        Expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the
        ISS.[23] The initial expedition crew size was three, temporarily
        decreased to two following the Columbia disaster. Since May 2009,
        expedition crew size has been six crew members.[24] Crew size is
        expected to be increased to seven, the number the ISS was designed for,
        once the Commercial Crew Program becomes operational.[25] The ISS has
        been continuously occupied for the past 23 years and 122 days, having
        exceeded the previous record held by Mir; and has been visited by
        astronauts and cosmonauts from 15 different nations.[26][27] The station
        can be seen from the Earth with the naked eye and, as of 2024, is the
        largest artificial satellite in Earth orbit with a mass and volume
        greater than that of any previous space station.[28] The Russian Soyuz
        and American Dragon spacecraft are used to send astronauts to and from
        the ISS. Several uncrewed cargo spacecraft provide service to the ISS;
        they are the Russian Progress spacecraft which has done so since 2000,
        the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) since 2008, the Japanese
        H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) since 2009, the (uncrewed) Dragon since
        2012, and the American Cygnus spacecraft since 2013.[29][30] The Space
        Shuttle, before its retirement, was also used for cargo transfer and
        would often switch out expedition crew members, although it did not have
        the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay. Between
        the retirement of the Shuttle in 2011 and the commencement of crewed
        Dragon flights in 2020, American astronauts exclusively used the Soyuz
        for crew transport to and from the ISS[31] The highest number of people
        occupying the ISS has been thirteen; this occurred three times during
        the late Shuttle ISS assembly missions.[32] The ISS program is expected
        to continue to 2030,[33] after which the space station will be retired
        and destroyed in a controlled de-orbit.

      <h2>What are astronauts called?</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        "Astronaut" technically applies to all human space travelers regardless
        of nationality. However, astronauts fielded by Russia or the Soviet
        Union are typically known instead as cosmonauts (from the Russian
        "kosmos" (космос), meaning "space", also borrowed from Greek κόσμος).
